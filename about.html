      <p>Our journey from the mid‑hills of Nepal to your cup, one mindful pour at a time.</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      POUR was born from a simple gesture – the act of pouring tea for a loved one. Our founder,
      raised in the clay streets of Madhyapur Thimi, grew up watching elders brew herbal decoctions
      and black teas to accompany every conversation, celebration and silence. Inspired by the Zen
      ensō and the sacred circle of giving, he sought to create a space where tea becomes an
      invitation into presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We partner with women farmers and small cooperatives across Nepal’s mid‑hills and Himalayan
      foothills. Each leaf we source is hand‑picked, sun‑withered and rolled with intention.
      Our packaging is compostable and plastic‑free, honouring the land from which our teas emerge.
    </p>
    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      To us, tea is more than a beverage – it’s a ritual that anchors body and heart. Each pour
      is a chance to slow down, listen and reconnect with the stories of those who tend the gardens
      and the spirits of the mountains that nurture them. We weave threads of Nepali, Tibetan and
      Zen traditions into our ceremonies, inviting you to savour a cup as you would a poem: with
      attention, curiosity and respect.
    </p>
    <h2>Heritage</h2>
    <p>
      Our lineage traces back to generations of Newar artisans and tea traders. Growing up between
      the monasteries of Patan and the terraced hills of Ilam, we carry both the contemplative
      stillness of temple courtyards and the earthy resilience of farmers. POUR is our way of
      honouring that heritage and sharing it with a global community.
